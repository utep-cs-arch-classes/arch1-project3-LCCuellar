Lab 3: LCD Game

This project creates a simple video game in the MSP430 LCD screen. The video game is as follows: The user controlls the movable orange circle at the bottom of the screen using the 4 switches. Switch 1 moves the player to the left, Switch 4 moves the player to the right, and Switch 2 and Switch 3 shoot 1 bullet at a time each. The objective of the game is to shoot at the 8 enemies that appear 1 by on the top of the screen, if an enemy touches the player, the game is over. As the player progresses through the game, the enemies become faster and more unpredictable. The game is finally won when the player has shot 8 enemines.






The program is ran by calling the command 'make all' in the directory arch1-project3-LCCuellar, then inside the project folder, the program can be ran using the comand 'make load'.
